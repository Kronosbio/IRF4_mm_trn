-RNA data (R), includes RNA data, notebooks used for LogFC calculation between WT and tested conditions, as well as some accompanying QC figures.

-Public data includes data that was collected from public resources

-figure n contains code used to generated figures observed within the manuscript. Generally base figures were made and then aesthetics were updated within Adobe Illustrator for figure generation.

Some data is not included here (for example DepMap 22Q4 Chronos scores, or some of the MACS1.4 outputs) due to sizing being over the available sizing limits for github.
