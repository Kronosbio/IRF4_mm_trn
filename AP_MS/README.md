# AP-MS MM TF 
Code relevant to AP-MS work down within manuscript. 

Much of this work was done following revisions, and submission was during R&D closure. As such, it was not organized into figure folders due uncertainty of which figrues it would be related to. 

The code in this folder contains the following:
1. Process FragPipe output files using MSstats (LFQ, calculate protein abundance from peptide intensities measured in mass spec)
2. Differential analysis for AP-MS
3. Calculate stoichiometry and make the final figures in the poster.
